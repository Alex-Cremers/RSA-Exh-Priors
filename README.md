# RSA-Exh-Priors
Data and analysis scripts for Cremers, Wilcox &amp; Spector's paper on the exhaustivity effects and priors in the RSA framework.

The corresponding manuscript is available on arXiv. The study was pre-registered and relevant documents can be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/xr435/). 

# Data
The data was initially collected with a HIT approval rate of 99% on MTurk, but this was too slow so we relaxed it to 98%. This is reflected in the name of the data files.

# Scripts
`RSAExh-Main.R` is loads functions from the two other R files as well as the data.
