# RSA-Exh-Priors
Data and analysis scripts for Cremers, Wilcox &amp; Spector's paper ["Exhaustivity and Anti-Exhaustivity in the RSA Framework: Testing the Effect of Prior Beliefs"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13286)

The study was pre-registered and relevant documents can be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/xr435/). 

# Data
The data was initially collected with a HIT approval rate of 99% on MTurk, but this was too slow so we relaxed it to 98%. This is reflected in the name of the data files.

# Scripts
`RSAExh-Main.R` loads functions from the two other R files as well as the data.
